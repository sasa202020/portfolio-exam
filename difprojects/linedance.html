  <summary>About what is line dance</summary>
  <div class="faq__content">
    <hr>
    <p>Essentially it's a choreography or sequence of repeated moves that you dance in lines (as the name suggests) ðŸ™‚ 
      typically you would see older people doing this to for example country songs but there are lots of songs and chorographies 
      that are line dancing that you would be surprised young generation is vibing to as well! Like for example macarena, yerusalema or saturday night..

  <summary>What is technique of the line dance</summary>
  <div class="faq__content">
    <hr>
    <p>It has some set of rules just like any other dance style and basic steps. Once you master these then you should have no issues grasping even the most difficult choreography.
       It's all about building your muscle memory, musicality and getting good coordination - these are strong foundations that are important for any kind of dance really</p>

  <summary>How do you choose music for dances?</summary>
  <div class="faq__content">
    <hr>
    <p>Whatever makes my body move is a good way to go! Sometimes when I'm not sure I do the "crowd test" when I play the song during a party and try to see how the crowd responds 
      to it - if they go crazy I know that it will create a good energy in the dance as well. I try to change it up a bit and sometimes go for current banger, other times going for a 
      nostalgic hit from early 2000s or the 90s.</p>
